    st.write("Ethereum is a platform powered by blockchain technology that is best known for its native cryptocurrency,"
             " called ether, or ETH, or simply ethereum. The distributed nature of blockchain technology is what makes "
             "the Ethereum platform secure, and that security enables ETH to accrue value.")
    st.write("The Ethereum platform supports ether in addition to a network of decentralized apps, otherwise known as "
             "dApps. Smart contracts, which originated on the Ethereum platform, are a central component of how the "
             "platform operates. Many decentralized finance (DeFi) and other applications use smart contracts in "
             "conjunction with blockchain technology. As a cryptocurrency, Ethereum is second in market value only to "
             "Bitcoin as of January 2022.")
    st.write("Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, uses blockchain technology. Imagine a very long chain of blocks linked "
             "together, with all of the information about each block known to every member of the blockchain network. "
             "With every member of the network having the same knowledge of the blockchain, which functions like an "
             "electronic ledger, distributed consensus can be created and maintained about the status of the blockchain.")

    st.write("Blockchain technology creates distributed consensus about the state of the Ethereum network. New blocks are"
             " added to the very long Ethereum blockchain to process Ethereum transactions and mint new ether coins, or "
             "to execute smart contracts for Ethereum dApps.")

    st.write("The Ethereum network derives its security from the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. A vast network of computers "
             "worldwide maintains the Ethereum blockchain network, and the network requires distributed consensus—majority"
             " agreement—for any changes to be made to the blockchain. An individual or group of network participants "
             "would need to gain majority control of the Ethereum platform’s computing power—a task that would be "
             "gargantuan, if not impossible—to successfully manipulate the Ethereum blockchain.")

    st.write("The Ethereum platform can support many more applications than ETH and other cryptocurrencies. The network’s "
             "users can create, publish, monetize, and use a diverse range of applications on the Ethereum platform, and "
             "can use ETH or another cryptocurrency as payment.")

    st.header("History")

    st.write("Vitalik Buterin, who is credited with conceiving the original Ethereum concept, published a white paper "
             "to introduce Ethereum in 2013. The Ethereum platform was launched in 2015 by Buterin and Joe Lubin, "
             "founder of the blockchain software company ConsenSys. The founders of Ethereum were among the first to "
             "consider the full potential of blockchain technology, beyond just enabling the secure trading of virtual "
             "currency.")

    st.write("One notable event in Ethereum’s history is the hard fork, or split, of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. "
             "In 2016, a group of network participants gained majority control of the Ethereum blockchain to steal more "
             "than $50 million worth of ether, which had been raised for a project called the DAO. The success of the "
             "raid was attributed to involvement by a third-party developer for the new project. While the majority of "
             "the Ethereum community opted to reverse the theft by invalidating the existing Ethereum blockchain and "
             "approving a blockchain with a revised history, a fraction of the community chose to maintain the original "
             "version of the Ethereum blockchain. That unaltered version of Ethereum permanently split to become the "
             "cryptocurrency Ethereum Classic, or ETC.")

    st.write("Since the launch of Ethereum, ether as a cryptocurrency has risen to become the second-largest cryptocurrency "
             "by market value. It is outranked only by Bitcoin.")

    st.header("The Future of Ethereum")

    st.write("Ethereum’s transition to the proof of stake protocol, which enables users to validate transactions and mint"
             " new ETH based on their ether holdings, is part of a major upgrade to the Ethereum platform known as Eth2."
             " The upgrade also adds capacity to the Ethereum network to support its growth, which helps to address chronic"
             " network congestion problems that have driven up gas fees.")
