# CryptoBase

In the past years we have seen that price of cryptocurrency rapidly grow due to its great return. 
So, our team explored several cryptocurrencies and we have decided to make a web-app that will display all the necessary things (like Basic info of particular crypto, their live pricing, 7 days graph, etc) along with hourly, 
weekly and monthly forecasting of crypto coins for better understanding of the nature of cryptocurrencies.

-> We are performing predictions on cryptocurrencies using timeseries arima model and we are plotting the result of 1 week and 1 month forecasting.

-> We are also plotting hourly (upto 6 hours) forecasted values.

-> Website is created and hosted using streamlit.

-> Data retrival is from YFinance and Cryptocompare.

-> Basic libraries we used are: matplotlib, plotly, pandas, numpy and statsmodel

-> For spinner animation we used lottie animation library.

-> This is just a demo work as we have developed this webiste as a part of our capstone project.

Happy coding!
